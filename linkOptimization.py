    :LL  : length in [km] - transmittivity is exp( -0.05*LL)
    Regarding the number of photons per pulse "nP" defined below :
    At 1550nm, a 100mW transmitter will emit at most 100*10^16 photons per second. Current systems use no more than 100mW.
    These 100mW are spread over all frequencies used by the different channels. According to ITU there are 144 50GHz channels in the C-band.
    Today's commercial systems emit in the order of 10*10^9 pulses per second, so that nP=10^5 reflects today's systems.
    A very futuristic system might have 100 times more pulses per second, using both C- and O band, for example. Then setting nP=10^3 is more accurate.
